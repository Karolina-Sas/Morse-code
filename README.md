# Morse-code
This project uses a Raspberry Pico microcontroller to control LED lights according to Morse signal letters. The user enters any combination of text, and the corresponding (long or short) light signals are generated by the LEDs. The display also shows the dash/dot notation for each letter. 

## Tools and materials used 
- Raspberry Pi Pico - RP2040
-  breadboard
-  three 330 Î© resistors
-  three green LEDs
-  male-to-male (M2M) jumper wires
-  micro USB cable
